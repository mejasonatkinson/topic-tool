# PREMIUM BONDS

[NS&I Premium Bonds](https://www.nsandi.com/products/premium-bonds) are a savings account you can put money into (and take out when you want), where the interest paid is decided by a monthly prize draw. You buy £1 bonds and each has an equal chance of winning, so the more you buy, the more your chances improve.

NS&I sexes up the draw by personifying its IT equipment – it calls it Ernie (Electronic Random Number Indicator Equipment). In reality, it's a simple, audited, random number generator. [Money Saving Expert](https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/savings/premium-bonds/)
