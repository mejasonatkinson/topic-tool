# SAVING

Saving is income not spent.

Saving also involves reducing expenditures, such as recurring costs. 

In terms of personal finance, saving generally specifies low-risk preservation of money, as in a deposit account, versus investment, wherein risk is a lot higher; in economics more broadly, it refers to any income not used for immediate consumption. Saving does not automatically include interest. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving)
