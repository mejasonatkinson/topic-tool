# Topic Tool

A simple tool to help me focus.

I have been struggling to figure out what to focus on lately, so I have made this small JavaScript "App". To hopefully narrow down my focus.

Which ever topic is picked. I will focus on for the week, or set time period.

At the moment the topics list in the tool are mostly carreer focused. and how I am focusing on them is mainly around completing a course on the topic BUT I fully understand the importance of creating projects; so I am in the process of trying to generate rpoject ideas. Which could also include.

1. PHP
2. Docker
3. Node JS 

-- BREAK --

I need to spend some time reflecting on what I have done, and what I can do better before moving on.

4. Craft CMS
5. Strapi CMS

Notes from reflections, 

I am bad at writing notes, I tend to write down anything I think might be important, this includes things such as: 

- Long sections of code
- Step by Step Instructions
- Defining what something means or is

The Long sections of code end up being meanless to me, as I don't understand how each piece fits together.

What actions should I take?

- Spend time reviewing and expanding on each part of the syntax. 
- Practise writing the syntax, to see it working, in a different context to the example.
- Update notes, when needed.
- Make note, and look into topics which are only briefly mentioned.

The Step by Step Instructions, when putting them into practise don't work as expected.

What actions should I take?

- Things change, and when they do. My notes need to be updated to reflect the changes.

Defining what something means, is normally the simplest part for me. BUT it is best still to review this, to make sure that it still makes sense.
