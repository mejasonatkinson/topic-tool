# Topic Tool

A simple tool to help me focus.

I have been struggling to figure out what to focus on lately, so I have made this small JavaScript "App". To hopefully narrow down my focus.

Which ever topic is picked. I will focus on for the week, or set time period.

At the moment the topics list in the tool are mostly carreer focused. and how I am focusing on them is mainly around completing a course on the topic BUT I fully understand the importance of creating projects; so I am in the process of trying to generate rpoject ideas. Which could also include.

1. PHP 27/08/22 - 02/09/22
2. Docker 03/09/22 - 10/09/22
3. NodeJS 10/09/22 - 22/09/22

## BREAK

I need to spend some time reflecting on what I have done, and what I can do better before moving on.

4. React ##/##/22 -
5. Svelte ##/##/22 -

Run `python -m http.server 8000` to start a server.
