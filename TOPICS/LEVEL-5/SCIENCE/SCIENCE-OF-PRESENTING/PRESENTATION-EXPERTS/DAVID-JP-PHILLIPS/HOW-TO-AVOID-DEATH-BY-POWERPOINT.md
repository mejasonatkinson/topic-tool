# [HOW TO AVOID DEATH BY POWERPOINT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwpi1Lm6dFo)

Why do our PowerPoints look the way they look?
Or rather, How on earth, can we accept that they look the way they look?

Now, my passion in life is the brain,
and an even bigger passion that is presentation skills.
And I love combining these two.

I searched the world, I looked for seminars,
I looked for training programs, I looked for books
that could solve this question for me,
but there was none to be found.

So I thought, 'Well, I'll just do as Franz Kafka said,
"If it isn't written, write it yourself."'

90% of what you said
was gone within 30 seconds.

one of the most leading neurologists called John Medina,
and he puts it like this.
[If companies would have as little respect for business
as they have for presentations,
the majority would go bankrupt.]

Five design principles that will cognitively and psychologically optimise your PowerPoint slides.

1. One message per slide.

So, why should we only have one message per slide?

We are extremely limited to understanding more.

John Sweller and Mayer - 'the redundancy effect'

If you have text, sentences on your PowerPoint,
and you persist with the annoying idea of speaking at the same time,
what will be remembered by the audience
is zero. Or very close to zero.

2. Use PowerPoint for what it's supposed to be used for; to hold the presentation material: short, sweet bits of text and an image.

3. Size = Focus

you will focus on four things:

- moving objects, 
- signalling colours, like red, orange and yellow,
- contrast-rich objects 
- big objects 

The most important part of your PowerPoint
should also be the biggest, nothing else.

4. Contrast = Focus

Contrast controls your focus.

Can be used to show amazing big tables 
if you use the effect of contrast.
you know exactly what to focus on.

Who has the highest contrast, me or the screen?
the screen.
Who's usually the biggest, me or the screen?
the screen.

So the only option I have is dress myself up in signalling colours
and jump around on stage in order to balance the problem out.

I think the long-term strategy is to just switch it around.
PowerPoint is not supposed to have white backgrounds.
Your eyes relax.

It's important because I am, I always have been,
and I always will be the presentation.

The Powerpoint is a visual aid.

5. Objects

To many objects creates anxiety

The magical number is six.

The amount of slides in your PowerPoint
has never been the problem.
It is the amount of objects per slide which has been the problem.


How many messages are you supposed to have per slide?
(Audience) One.

What can we use to steer our focus?
Contrast.
Yes, and another one?
Size.

What should we avoid using if speaking at the same time?
(Audience) Sentences.

And what kind of background should we have?
We should have dark.

How many objects per slide?
Six.
