- [HOW TO AVOID DEATH BY POWERPOINT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwpi1Lm6dFo)

Why do our PowerPoints look the way they look?
Or rather, How on earth, can we accept that they look the way they look?

Now, my passion in life is the brain,
and an even bigger passion that is presentation skills.
And I love combining these two.

I searched the world, I looked for seminars,
I looked for training programs, I looked for books
that could solve this question for me,
but there was none to be found.

So I thought, 'Well, I'll just do as Franz Kafka said,
"If it isn't written, write it yourself."'

90% of what you said
was gone within 30 seconds.

one of the most leading neurologists called John Medina,
and he puts it like this.
[If companies would have as little respect for business
as they have for presentations,
the majority would go bankrupt.]

Five design principles that will cognitively and psychologically optimise your PowerPoint slides.

1. One message per slide.

So, why should we only have one message per slide?

We are extremely limited to understanding more.

John Sweller and Mayer - 'the redundancy effect'

If you have text, sentences on your PowerPoint,
and you persist with the annoying idea of speaking at the same time,
what will be remembered by the audience
is zero. Or very close to zero.

2. Use PowerPoint for what it's supposed to be used for; to hold the presentation material: short, sweet bits of text and an image.

3. Size = Focus

you will focus on four things:

- moving objects, 
- signalling colours, like red, orange and yellow,
- contrast-rich objects 
- big objects 

The most important part of your PowerPoint
should also be the biggest, nothing else.

4. Contrast = Focus

...

Contrast controls your focus.
So, what does that look like?
For instance, if I show you a list like this,
your eyes are over the place
because you don't really know what to focus on.
So, I'll use a built-in functionality into PowerPoint, which goes like this.
I'll show you the first subject, I'll take it away with contrast,
and I'll show you the second one,
and I'll do it again and again and again and again.
You're now following exactly the white spot.
If I do this - dun-dun-dun-dun -
I can see your eyes just wobbling around,
and you're a bit like a kitten going after a little laser pointer on the wall,
going like, 'Where is it? I've got it. I've got it.'
Because you're following where the white spot is, and not the rest.
Now, this is a beautiful example.
Please do use this.
Use it because you can show amazing big tables like this
if you use the effect of contrast, the principle of contrast.
Look what this looks like.
Your eyes are all over the place; you don't know what to focus on,
but I just apply the principle of contrast,
and it looks like that, and suddenly, you know exactly what to focus on.
Here, they're all over the place,
and here, they're exactly where I want them.
Now, there's a big, major drawback with PowerPoints,
and that is that the majority of companies on this earth today,
they persist in having white backgrounds in PowerPoint.
Look at that.
Oh, it's bright, it's shiny.
Could you tell me who has the highest contrast, me or the screen?
Well, the screen.
Who's usually the biggest, me or the screen?
Well, the screen.
So the only option I have is dress myself up in signalling colours
(Laughter)
and jump around on stage in order to balance that problem out,
and that is obviously not a good corporate strategy
in the long term, would it be?
I think the long-term strategy is to just switch it around.
PowerPoint is not supposed to have white backgrounds.
If I do this, your eyes relax.
You focus on me.
I'm the biggest object.
I'm the most contrast-rich object.
I got your focus.
Why is that important?
It's important because I am, I always have been,
and I always will be the presentation.
That is my visual aid.
Moving into the last principle, and that is objects.
Now, this is one of the most severe principles,
and it goes like this.
How many objects do I have here?
If you count them quickly, you'll see that I've got 16.
Do you see this little beauty at the end as well
which goes 'page 12 of 95'?
What is that?
Why do we do that?
That only creates anxiety.
If anything, you are, 'Oh my god, I can't take 83 more of those.'
(Laughter)
But, it can also create hope
because imagine ...
imagine when it's 90 out of 95.
'Oh, I can see the lights; I can see the end of the tunnel.'
Kidding aside, don't do that.
Now, there are so many ideas out there
on how many objects you're supposed to have in PowerPoint,
and once and for all, I just want to put my foot down
and state to you that this is the perfect amount.
In order to do that, I want you to just feel it yourself.
How many objects are you supposed to have?
And we're going to do that by showing you a couple of balls.
I'll throw up the balls.
I want you to nod to me when you've counted them.
Simple instruction. You with me?
Cool, here we go.
Boom.
Alright, takes you about two seconds.
Good. Well done.
Your next set of balls.
Count them, and nod to me when you've counted them.
Here we go.
Excellent. Yeah.
That took you about 1.2 seconds if you're normal,
which about 90% of you seem to be.
(Laughter)
We'll have the third set of balls, the last one.
Look at this, nod to me when you've counted them.
Oh, what was that?
I just pressed the button, and you nodded simultaneously.
That will, if you are normal, take you 0.2 seconds,
two-tenths of a second.
This will take you 1.2, this will take you two-tenths of a second.
And for anyone of you who - you're good at math,
you'll find out that that number is approximately 500% difference.
How is that even remotely possible?
There are only two objects in difference.
Well, might I suggest the following:
this one you have to count,
and this one you see.
Could that be correct?
So what you've just experienced is the following:
that the cognitive process of counting
takes 500% longer time, requires 500% more energy resources
to execute than just seeing.
So, what I want you to keep in mind at all times,
what I want you to keep in your head is this:
[Sex]
which is the Swedish number for this:
[Six]
(Laughter)
The magical number is six.
It's not five, it's not seven, it's six.
And I want to make you aware of this.
When you go into a presentation in the future,
and you've built this amazing PowerPoint,
if you've got more than seven objects, or seven or more objects,
you have to be aware that all the people in there,
they have to use 500% more energy and cognitive resources
to understand what's in your PowerPoint.
Now, how do you think
their energy-saving brain by nature behaves?
Will it go like, 'Ooh, I'll easily invest 500% more cognitive resources
to understand this weird slide'
or, 'I won't'?
'I won't.'
And you've just incurred death by PowerPoint.
Now what does this look like in real life?
Well, have a look at this.
Sixteen objects - can we agree that that's too many?
Yes, we can.
So, what does it look like if we reduce it?
Look at this. We go from this to this.
And this is where your brain goes, 'Ahh'.
And this is where your brain goes, 'Ugh'.
Ahh.
(Laughter)
Ugh.
And I assume that in the future
when you deliver PowerPoints to your colleagues, to your fellow people,
you want them to go, 'Ahh'
when you show them your slides.
You don't want them to go, 'Ugh'.
Now, there is - have you seen this movie,
'The Rain Man' by Dustin Hoffman?
Seen that?
It's a beauty, isn't it?
He comes into this cafeteria, and somebody drops toothpicks,
and he goes like, 'Boom, 247.'
It's amazing, isn't it?
His perceptive limit is here.
Your perceptive limit
(Laughter)
is here.
Now, what amazes me
is that whichever country I go to, whichever company I see,
it seems like they build PowerPoints
in the hope that all their fellow colleagues are autistic or savants,
(Laughter)
which obviously is not the case.
So, but then you go like this, 'But, David, my god.
This means that I have to have more slides.'
(Laughter)
'Yes, that is entirely correct.
You have understood me clearly.'
I want to make one thing clear here,
and that is that the amount of slides in your PowerPoint
has never been the problem.
It is the amount of objects per slide which has been the problem.
The stupid idea
that corporate organisations all over the world -
they've come up with limitations going like,
'Ooh, we've got this clever idea:
You can't use 40 slides. You can only use four.'
So what do people do?
(Laughter)
Well, they take the content of the rest 36,
and they jam it in the first four.
My god, is that counterproductive or what?
And we call ourselves intelligent.
No, no.
Alright, so compared -
I started off with 95 of those.
We ended up with 135 of these.
And yes, it gave an immediate result
to the application that we were working for.
So, to summarise this.
Let's have some fun and do a cross-examination
because obviously I have to prove my point.
Do you remember more than 90% of what I said?
I'm not going to be that harsh.
Let's do a crossword instead.
It's going to go like this.
Words are going to come up.
I'm going to ask you to scream them out as loud as you can as we go along.
How many messages are you supposed to have per slide?
(Audience) One.
One. Very good.
(Laughter)
I think you were looking for a different word there.
(Laughter)
What can we use to steer our focus?
(Audience) Contrast.
Yes, and another one?
(Audience) Size.
Well done.
What should we avoid using if speaking at the same time?
(Audience) Sentences.
Beautiful.
And what kind of background should we have?
We should have dark.
And finally, now you can say it.
How many objects per slide?
Six. That is magnificent.
Thank you very much.
(Applause) (Cheers)
