# ECMASCRIPT

ECMAScript is a JavaScript standard intended to ensure the interoperability of web pages across different browsers. It is standardized by Ecma International in the document ECMA-262.

ECMAScript is commonly used for client-side scripting on the World Wide Web, and it is increasingly being used for writing server-side applications and services using Node.js and other runtime environments. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript)
